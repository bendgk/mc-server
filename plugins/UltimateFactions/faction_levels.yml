# You can simply add a faction level by copying an existing level and changing some options
#
# example:
#
# 1: # this is the level of the faction
#   cost: 100000    # here you can set the cost you need to upgrade the faction to the next level
#   fly: false      # here you can choose if faction fly should be disabled or enabled in this level
#   fill: false     # here you can choose if faction fill should be disabled or enabled in this level (puts tnt out of your inventory directly in a dispenser)
#   member: 10      # here you can choose the maximum member count in a faction in this level
#   warps: 2        # here you can choose the maximum amount of warps in a faction in this level
#   warp-cooldown: 10  # here you can choose the warp-delay time in a faction in this level
#   claims: 10      # here you can choose the maximum amount of claims a faction can have in this level
#   mobdrop-multiplier: 0.1   # here you can choose the multiplier a mob drops more items (DONT SET TO 0.0 TO AVOID CONSOLE ERRORS)
#   potion-effects:     # here you can edit the potion effects that a player has in its factions chunk
#     enabled: false    # set to true if the effects should be enabled
#     effects:          # here you can add the effects a player should have
#       - jump_boost
#   max-active-quests: 1 # here you can set the maximum amount of active quests a faction can have
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
